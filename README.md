# Abstract

BTN has created a POE (Proof of Existence) consensus algorithm mechanism in the world, innovatively developing Asymmetric secret key drawing, Multiple level seals and other core solutions. 

Taking asymmetric encryption algorithm and IBC identity cryptographic algorithm as a mixed underlayer, 
a decentralized blockchain trusted platform which realizes high-performance concurrence and unlimited expansion in the complete smart contract is formed through Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge (NIZK) and Trusted Platform Module(TPM).

It integrates the hardware scheme for trusted computing chips. In the OSI (Open System Interconnect), IBC (Identity-Based Cryptograph) is adopted for point-to-point trusted identity authentication and digital asset transaction in IBS (Identity-Based SignCrypt). 

The mutual authentication and key negotiation protocol within and between domains based on CL-PKC is guaranteed with flexible security and privacy
