# About BTN

BTN has created a POE (Proof of Existence) consensus algorithm mechanism in the world, innovatively developing Asymmetric secret key drawing, multiple level seals and other core solutions. 

Taking RSA cryptographic algorithm and IBC identity cryptographic algorithm as a mixed underlayer, a blockchain trusted platform which realizes high-performance concurrence and unlimited expansion in the complete Turing smart contract is formed through Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge (NIZK) and Trusted Platform Module(TPM).

It aims at providing a convenient, safe and trusted blockchain application gateway for different roles and institutions on the network and connecting various trust value islands to the value network.

“BTN” is a trusted blockchain network based on decentralization, which integrates the hardware scheme for trusted computing chips. In the OSI (Open System Interconnect), IBC (Identity-Based Cryptograph) is adopted for point-to-point trusted identity authentication and digital asset transaction in IBS (Identity-Based SignCrypt). The mutual authentication and key negotiation protocol within and between domains based on CL-PKC is guaranteed with flexible security and privacy.
